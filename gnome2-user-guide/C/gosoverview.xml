  <para>This chapter introduces you to some of the very basic components of the desktop. These components include <glossterm>Windows</glossterm>, <glossterm>Workspaces</glossterm>, and <glossterm>Applications</glossterm>. Almost all the work (or play) that you do in GNOME will involve these very basic components.</para>
  
  <note>
  <para>This chapter describes the default configuration of GNOME.
  Your vendor or system administrator may have configured your
  desktop to look different than what is described here.</para>

  <para>When you start a desktop session for the first time,
  you should see a default startup screen, with panels, windows,
  and various icons.</para>
  
  <para>The major components of the desktop are as follows:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Panels</term>
      <listitem><para>The <firstterm>panels</firstterm> are the two bars that run along the top and bottom of the screen. By default, the top panel shows you the GNOME main menu bar, the date and time, and the launcher for the GNOME help system, and the bottom panel shows you the list of open windows and the workspace switcher.</para>
      <para>Panels can be customized to contain a variety of tools, such as other menus and launchers, and small utility applications, called
      <firstterm>panel applets</firstterm>. For example, you can configure
      your panel to display the current weather for your location.  For more
      information on panels, see <xref linkend="panels"/>.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Most applications run inside of one or more windows.
      You can display multiple windows on your desktop at the same time.
      Windows can be resized and moved around to accomodate your workflow.
      Each window has a <firstterm>titlebar</firstterm> at the top with
      buttons which allow you to minimize, maximize, and close the window.

  </indexterm>

  <para>A <firstterm>window</firstterm> is a rectangular area of the screen, usually with a border all around and a title bar at the top. You can think of a window as a screen within the screen. Each window displays an application, allowing you to to have more than one application visible, and work on more than one task at a time. You can also think of windows as pieces of paper on your desktop: they can overlap, or be side by side, for example.</para>
  
  <para>You can control a window's position of the screen, as well as its size. You can control which windows overlap other windows, so the one you want to work with is completely visible. For more about moving and resizing windows, see <xref linkend="windows-manipulating"/>.</para>
  
  <para>Each window is not necessarily a different application. An application usually has one main window, and may open additional windows at the request of the user.</para>

  <para>The rest of this section describe the different types of windows and how you
  can interact with them.</para>

  <section id="windows-types">
    <title>Types of Windows</title>

    <para>There are two main types of window:</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Application windows</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Application windows allow all the minimize, 
            maximize and close operations through the buttons on the titlebar. 
            When opening an application you will usually see a 
            window of this type appear.</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Dialog windows</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Dialog windows appear at the request of an application window. A dialog window may alert you to a problem, ask for confirmation of an action, or request input from you.</para>
            
            <para>For example, if you tell an application to save a document, a dialog box will ask you where you want to save the new file. If you tell an application to quit while it is still busy, it may ask you to confirm that you want it to abandon work in progress.</para>
            
            <para>Some dialogs do not allow you to interact with the main application window until you have closed them: these are called <firstterm>modal</firstterm> dialogs. Others can be left open while you work with the main application window: these are called <firstterm>transient</firstterm> dialogs.</para>
            
            <tip><para>You can select the text in a dialog with the mouse. This allows you to copy it to the clipboard (CTRL-C to copy), and paste it into another application. You may wish to quote the text you see in a dialog box when requesting support on the internet.</para></tip>

    <title>Manipulating Windows</title>

    <!-- Maintained for 2.8 compatibility -->
    <anchor id="gosoverview-32"/>

    <para>You can change the size and position of windows on the screen. This allows you to see more than one application and do diferent tasks at the same time. For example, you might want to read text on a web page and write with a word procesor; or simple change to another application to do a diferent task or see the progress.</para> 
    
    <para>You can <firstterm>minimize</firstterm> a window if you are not currently interested in seeing it. This hides it from view. You can <firstterm>maximise</firstterm> a window to fill the whole screen so you can give it your full attention.</para> 
    
    <para>Most of these actions are carried out by using the mouse on different parts of the the window's frame (see <xref linkend="mouse-actions"/> for a recap of using the mouse). The top edge of the window frame, called the <firstterm>titlebar</firstterm> because it also displays the title of the window, contains several buttons that change the way the window is displayed. <xref linkend="fig-titlebar-anno-window"/> shows the titlebar for a typical application window.</para>

Common actions can also be carried out with keyboard shortcuts: see <xref linkend="shortcuts-window"/> for a simple list of these. The following lists all the actions you can carry out on a window, with the mouse or the keyboard:</para>

    <para>You can display many windows at the same time in your GNOME Desktop.
Your windows are displayed in subdivisions of the GNOME Desktop that are called
workspaces. A workspace is a discrete area in which you can work. </para>
    <para>Every workspace contains the same desktop, the same panels, and the
same menus. However, you can run different applications, and open different
windows in each workspace. You can display only one workspace at a time in
the GNOME Desktop but you can have windows open in other workspaces.  </para>
    <para>Workspaces enable you to organize the GNOME Desktop when you run many
applications at the same time. When your current workspace becomes crowded
with windows, you can move your work to another workspace. You can also switch
to another workspace then start more applications.</para>
    <para>Workspaces are displayed in the <application>Workspace Switcher</application>

    <para>The applications that are provided with the GNOME Desktop
share several characteristics. For example, the applications have a consistent
look-and-feel. The applications share characteristics because the applications
use the same programming libraries. An application that uses the standard
GNOME programming libraries is called a <firstterm>GNOME-compliant application</firstterm>. For example, <application>Nautilus</application> and the <application>gedit</application> text editor are GNOME-compliant applications.</para>
    <para>GNOME provides libraries in addition to the libraries provided by your
operating system. The libraries enable GNOME to run your existing applications
as well as GNOME-compliant applications. For example, if your operating system
is UNIX-based, you can run your current X11 applications and Motif applications
from the GNOME Desktop.</para>
    <para>Some of the features of GNOME-compliant applications are as follows:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Consistent look-and-feel</para>
        <para>GNOME-compliant applications have a consistent look-and-feel. GNOME-compliant
applications use the look-and-feel settings that you specify in the preference
tools. You can use the following tools to change the look-and-feel of your
GNOME-compliant applications:<itemizedlist><listitem><para><application>Menus &amp; Toolbars</application> preference

The menubar always contains a <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu and a <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu. The <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu always contains an <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> menu item, and the <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu always
contains an <guimenuitem>About</guimenuitem> menu item.</para>
        <para>A <firstterm>toolbar</firstterm> is a bar that appears under the menubar.
A toolbar contains buttons for the most commonly-used commands. A <firstterm>statusbar</firstterm> is a bar at the bottom of a window that provides information
about the current state of what you are viewing in the window. GNOME-compliant
applications might also contains other bars. For example, <application>Nautilus</application> contains a location bar.</para>
        <para>Some of the bars in GNOME-compliant applications are detachable. That
is, the bar has a handle that you can grab then drag the bar to another location.
You can drag the bar to snap to another side of the window, or to another
part of the screen. For example, you can detach the menubar, toolbar, and
location bar in the file manager. </para>

        <para>Default shortcut keys</para>
        <para>GNOME-compliant applications use the same shortcut keys to perform the
same actions. For example, to quit a GNOME-compliant application, press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Q</keycap></keycombo>. To undo an action in a GNOME-compliant
application, press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>. </para>

        <para>Drag-and-drop</para>
        <para>GNOME-compliant applications use the same protocol to implement drag-and-drop
operations. Therefore, GNOME-compliant applications provide consistent feedback
when you drag-and-drop items.</para>
        <para>The use of the same protocol also enables GNOME-compliant applications
to interoperate in a sophisticated manner. For example, GNOME-compliant applications
recognize the format of the items that you drag. When you drag a HTML file
from a <application>Nautilus</application> window to a web browser, the file
is displayed in HTML format in the browser. However, when you drag the HTML
file to a text editor, the file is displayed in plain text format in the text
editor. </para>
