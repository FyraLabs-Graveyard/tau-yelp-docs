  <para>The major components of the desktop are as follows:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Panels</term>
      <listitem><para>The <firstterm>panels</firstterm> are the two bars that run along the top and bottom of the screen. By default, the top panel shows you the GNOME main menu bar, the date and time, and the launcher for the GNOME help system, and the bottom panel shows you the list of open windows and the workspace switcher.</para>
      <para>Panels can be customized to contain a variety of tools, such as other menus and launchers, and small utility applications, called
      <firstterm>panel applets</firstterm>. For example, you can configure
      your panel to display the current weather for your location.  For more

  <indexterm>

    <secondary>overview</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>A <firstterm>window</firstterm> is a rectangular area of the screen, usually with a border all around and a title bar at the top. You can think of a window as a screen within the screen. Each window displays an application, allowing you to to have more than one application visible, and work on more than one task at a time. You can also think of windows as pieces of paper on your desktop: they can overlap, or be side by side, for example.</para>
  
  <para>You can control a window's position of the screen, as well as its size. You can control which windows overlap other windows, so the one you want to work with is completely visible. For more about moving and resizing windows, see <xref linkend="windows-manipulating"/>.</para>
  
  <para>Each window is not necessarily a different application. An application usually has one main window, and may open additional windows at the request of the user.</para>

  <para>The rest of this section describe the different types of windows and how you
  can interact with them.</para>

  <section id="windows-types">
    <title>Types of Windows</title>

    <para>There are two main types of window:</para>

        <term>Application windows</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Application windows allow all the minimize, 
            maximize and close operations through the buttons on the titlebar. 
            When opening an application you will usually see a 
            window of this type appear.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Dialog windows</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Dialog windows appear at the request of an application window. A dialog window may alert you to a problem, ask for confirmation of an action, or request input from you.</para>
            
            <para>For example, if you tell an application to save a document, a dialog box will ask you where you want to save the new file. If you tell an application to quit while it is still busy, it may ask you to confirm that you want it to abandon work in progress.</para>
            
            <para>Some dialogs do not allow you to interact with the main application window until you have closed them: these are called <firstterm>modal</firstterm> dialogs. Others can be left open while you work with the main application window: these are called <firstterm>transient</firstterm> dialogs.</para>
            
            <tip><para>You can select the text in a dialog with the mouse. This allows you to copy it to the clipboard (CTRL-C to copy), and paste it into another application. You may wish to quote the text you see in a dialog box when requesting support on the internet.</para></tip>

    <title>Manipulating Windows</title>

    <!-- Maintained for 2.8 compatibility -->
    <anchor id="gosoverview-32"/>

    <para>You can change the size and position of windows on the screen. This allows you to see more than one application and do diferent tasks at the same time. For example, you might want to read text on a web page and write with a word procesor; or simple change to another application to do a diferent task or see the progress.</para> 
    
    <para>You can <firstterm>minimize</firstterm> a window if you are not currently interested in seeing it. This hides it from view. You can <firstterm>maximise</firstterm> a window to fill the whole screen so you can give it your full attention.</para> 
    
    <para><anchor id="gosoverview-FIG-33"/>Most of these actions are carried out by using the mouse on different parts of the the window's frame (see <xref linkend="mouse-actions"/> for a recap of using the mouse). The top edge of the window frame, called the <firstterm>titlebar</firstterm> because it also displays the title of the window, contains several buttons that change the way the window is displayed. <xref linkend="fig-titlebar-anno-window"/> shows the titlebar for a typical application window.</para>

    <para>All actions can also be carried out from the Window Menu. To open this, click on the Window Menu Button at the left-hand edge of the titlebar. Common actions can also be carried out with keyboard shortcuts: see <xref linkend="shortcuts-window"/> for a simple list of these. The following lists the actions you can carry out on a window, with the mouse or the keyboard:</para>

   <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Move the window</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Drag the titlebar to move the window. You can click on any part of the titlebar except the buttons at either end to begin the drag action. The window will move on the screen as you drag the mouse. On less powerful computers, the movement of the window may be represented by moving an outline of its frame.</para>
            
            <para>You can also choose Move from the Window Menu, or press <keycombo>
            <keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F7</keycap></keycombo>, and then either move the mouse or press the keyboard arrow keys to move the window.</para>

            <para>As you move the window, some parts of the screen will give slight resistance to movement. This is to help you align windows more easily to the edges of the desktop, the panels, and the edges of other windows.</para>
            
            <para>You can also press-and-hold <keycap>Shift</keycap> while you move the window to cause it to only move between the corners of the desktop and other windows.</para>
            
           <tip><para>If the <keycap>Num Lock</keycap> key is off, you can use the arrows on the numeric keypad, as well as the <keycap>7</keycap>, <keycap>9</keycap>, <keycap>1</keycap>, and <keycap>3</keycap> keys to move diagonally.</para></tip>

      <anchor id="gosoverview-20"/>       
      <para>To work with an application, you need to give the <firstterm>focus</firstterm> to its window. When a window has focus, any actions such as mouse clicks, typing text, or keyboard shortcuts, are directed to the application in that window. Only one window can have focus at a time. The window that has focus will appear on top of other windows, so nothing covers any part of it. It may also have a different appearance from other windows, depending on your choice of <link linkend="prefs-theme"> theme</link>.</para>
      <para>You can give the focus to a window in any of the following ways:</para>

    <para>Workspaces allow you to manage which windows are on your screen. You can imagine workspaces as being virtual screens, which you can switch between at any time. Every workspace contains the same desktop, the same panels, and the same menus. However, you can run different applications, and open different windows in each workspace. The applications in each workspace will remain there when you switch to other workspaces.</para>

    <para>By default, four workspaces are available. You can switch between them with the <application>Workspace Switcher</application> applet at the right of the <link linkend="bottom-panel">bottom panel</link>. This shows a representation of your workspaces, by default a row of four rectangles. Click on one to switch to that workspace. In <xref linkend="gosoverview-FIG-42"/>, <application>Workspace Switcher</application> contains four workspaces. The first three workspaces contain open windows. The last workspace does not contain currently open windows. The currently active workspace is highlighted.</para>

    <para>Further standard GNOME applications include games, music and video players, a web browser, software accessibility tools, and utilities to manage your system. Your distributor or vendor may have added other GNOME applications, such as a word processor and a graphics editor. Your distributor or vendor may alsoprovide you with a way to install further applications.</para>
    
    <para>All GNOME applications have many features in common, which makes it easier to learn how to work with a new GNOME application. The rest of this section describes some of these features.</para>

    <section id="overview-lookandfeel">
      <title>Common Features</title>
    
      <para>The applications that are provided with the GNOME Desktop
  share several characteristics. For example, the applications have a consistent
  look-and-feel. The applications share characteristics because the applications
  use the same programming libraries. An application that uses the standard
  GNOME programming libraries is called a <firstterm>GNOME-compliant application</firstterm>. For example, <application>Nautilus</application> and the <application>gedit</application> text editor are GNOME-compliant applications.</para>
      <para>GNOME provides libraries in addition to the libraries provided by your
  operating system. The libraries enable GNOME to run your existing applications
  as well as GNOME-compliant applications. For example, if your operating system
  is UNIX-based, you can run your current X11 applications and Motif applications
  from the GNOME Desktop.</para>
      <para>Some of the features of GNOME-compliant applications are as follows:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Consistent look-and-feel</para>
          <para>GNOME-compliant applications have a consistent look-and-feel. GNOME-compliant
  applications use the look-and-feel settings that you specify in the preference
  tools. You can use the following tools to change the look-and-feel of your
  GNOME-compliant applications:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Menubars, toolbars, and statusbars</para>
          <para>Most GNOME-compliant applications have a menubar, a toolbar, and a statusbar.
  The menubar always contains a <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu and a <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu. The <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu always contains an <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> menu item, and the <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu always
  contains an <guimenuitem>About</guimenuitem> menu item.</para>
          <para>A <firstterm>toolbar</firstterm> is a bar that appears under the menubar.
  A toolbar contains buttons for the most commonly-used commands. A <firstterm>statusbar</firstterm> is a bar at the bottom of a window that provides information
  about the current state of what you are viewing in the window. GNOME-compliant
  applications might also contains other bars. For example, <application>Nautilus</application> contains a location bar.</para>
          <para>Some of the bars in GNOME-compliant applications are detachable. That
  is, the bar has a handle that you can grab then drag the bar to another location.
  You can drag the bar to snap to another side of the window, or to another
  part of the screen. For example, you can detach the menubar, toolbar, and
  location bar in the file manager. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Default shortcut keys</para>
          <para>GNOME-compliant applications use the same shortcut keys to perform the
  same actions. For example, to quit a GNOME-compliant application, press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Q</keycap></keycombo>. To undo an action in a GNOME-compliant
  application, press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>. </para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Drag-and-drop</para>
          <para>GNOME-compliant applications use the same protocol to implement drag-and-drop
  operations. Therefore, GNOME-compliant applications provide consistent feedback
  when you drag-and-drop items.</para>
          <para>The use of the same protocol also enables GNOME-compliant applications
  to interoperate in a sophisticated manner. For example, GNOME-compliant applications
  recognize the format of the items that you drag. When you drag a HTML file
  from a <application>Nautilus</application> window to a web browser, the file
  is displayed in HTML format in the browser. However, when you drag the HTML
  file to a text editor, the file is displayed in plain text format in the text
  editor. </para>
