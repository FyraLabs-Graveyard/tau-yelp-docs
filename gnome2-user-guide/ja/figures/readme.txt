Two files in this directory are not referred to in the SGML User Guide: note.png, and gnome-logo-icon.png. 

In the HTML-ized version of the User Guide, these files are referred to. Place them in a directory called stylesheet at the same level as figures. That is:

user_guide_dir/
           figures/
           stylesheet/gnome-logo-icon.png
           stylesheet/note.png

The source files were obtained from: 

   /opt/gnome-2.0/share/xml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.48/images/note.png 
   /opt/gnome-2.0/share/pixmaps/gnome-logo-icon.png.
