<title>Add a guest user account</title>

<p>You can create a user account for guests, people who will only use the computer on a brief, temporary basis. The guest user will be able to use the programs on your computer, but they won't be able to access your files, mess with your settings or install apps.</p>

<!--Could conceivably do this by putting the guest user's home directory in /tmp:
<p>Guests can save files, but those files will be deleted when they log out. Everything about a guest account is temporary.</p>
-->

<p>To create a guest user account:</p>

<steps>
 <item><p>
      When in the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, <gui>Type to search</gui> 'users and groups'.  This will open the <app>Users Administration Tool</app>.   
    </p></item>
    <item><p>
      Click on <gui>Add</gui>.  You will be prompted for your password.
    </p></item>
    <item><p>
      In the <gui>Create a new user</gui> dialog, enter <input>guest</input> as the <gui>Name</gui>, and <input>guest</input> as the <gui>Username</gui>.  
    </p></item>
 <item>
  <p>When the <gui>Changing user password for guest</gui> window appears, enter a password, then check <gui>Don't ask for password on login</gui> and click <gui>OK</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>You will be returned to the Users Settings window. Make sure that <gui>guest</gui> is selected from the list on the left side of the window, and check that the account type is set to <gui>Desktop user</gui>.</p>
  <p>If it isn't, click the <gui>Change</gui> button to change the account type.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>You can change what the guest user is allowed access to on the computer. Click <gui>Advanced Settings</gui> and use the <gui>User Privileges</gui> tab to do this.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>When you've finished, close the Users Settings and try logging in to the guest user account.</p>
 </item>
</steps>
