  <title>I forgot my password!</title>
  <p>
     It is important to not only choose <link xref="user-goodpassword">a good and secure password</link>, but one that you can also remember.  In the event that you have forgotten the password to login to your computer account, you can follow the following steps to reset it.
  </p>
  <note style="important">
  <p>
     If you have an encrypted home directory, you will not be able to reset a forgotten password.
  </p>
  </note>
  <p>
  If you simply want to change your password, see <link xref="user-changepassword"/>.

           <note style="tip">
           <p>
           If you have a dual-boot machine and you choose at boot time which operating system to boot into, the grub menu should appear without the need to hold down the <key>Shift</key> key.

       After you successfully login, you will not be able to access your keyring (since you don't remember the old password).
