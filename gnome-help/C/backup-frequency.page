<title>Frequency of backups</title>

<p>How often you make backups will depend on the type of files to be backed up 
and how important they are. For example, if you have the accounts for your 
business stored on your computer, then even weekly backups may not be enough to 
make sure you don't lose anything important.</p>

<p>If you are backing-up files on your home computer, you may need to factor in 
things like:</p>

<list style="compact">
<item><p>The amount of time you spend on the computer.</p></item>
<item><p>How often and by how much the data on the computer changes.</p></item>
</list>

<p>
If the data you want to back up is lower priority or subject to few changes (like music, e-mails and family photos), then 
weekly or even monthly backups may suffice. However, if you happen to be in the middle of a tax audit, more frequent backups may be necessary.
</p>

<p>As a general rule, the amount of time in between backups should be no more than the amount of time 
you are willing to spend re-doing any lost work. For example, if spending a week re-writing lost documents 
is too long for you, you should back up at least once per week.</p>
