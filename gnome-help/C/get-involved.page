<p>This help system is created by a volunteer community. You are welcome to participate. If you notice a problem with these help pages (like typos, incorrect instructions or topics that should be covered but aren't), you can file a <em>bug report</em>. To file a bug, go to <link href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bugzilla.gnome.org</link>.</p>
   <p>
   You need to register so you can file a bug and receive updates by e-mail about its status. If you don't already have an account, just click on the <gui>New</gui> link to create one.

   Before reporting a bug, please read the <link href = "https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html">bug writing guidelines</link>,  and please <link href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=gnome-user-docs">browse</link> for the bug to see if something similar already exists.

   <p>
   To file your bug, choose the component in the <gui>Component</gui> menu.  If you are not sure which component your bug pertains to, choose <gui>general</gui>.
