<title>Resolve problems with wireless connections</title>

  <p>This guide is designed to help you troubleshoot and resolve problems with accessing a wireless network.</p>

  <note><p>Due to the technical nature of trouble-shooting network problems, this guide contains some commands that will need to be entered into a <app>terminal</app> window. While this may seem intimidating at first, these commands present the easiest way of getting the information that you need to restore your network access.</p></note>

  <steps>  
    <item><p>Perform a quick check</p></item>
    <item><p>Attempt to connect to your wireless router</p></item>

  </steps>
  <!-- <p>Hardware Check:</p>
  <p>For this section, it will be useful to have

    Your device
    The packaging and contents for your device
    A driver disc - even if it only contains Windows drivers.
    An alternate working internet connection for downloading software and drivers.</p> 

  <p>Initially, note down the following:

    Manufacturer
    Complete model number
    Any version numbers that may be printed on the device or its packaging. These can be crucial, so look carefully.
    Anything on the driver disc that identifies either the device itself or the components it uses. Wireless implementation chips are often operated by firmware, a type of software written specifically for that chip.</p>
