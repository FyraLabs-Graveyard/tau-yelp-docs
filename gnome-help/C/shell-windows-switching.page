Press <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq> to switch between windows.

<note style="tip">

<p>
 The windows are grouped by application and the previews of the applications with multiple windows are available as you click through. The previews show up after a short delay, but you can get them immediately by clicking the down arrow key. 
</p>

</note>


<note>
<p>
The applications running on other workspaces are displayed after a vertical separator. Including all applications in the <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq> makes switching between tasks a single step process and provides you with a full picture of what applications are running. 
</p>
</note>

<item><p> 
You can move between the preview windows with the right and left arrow keys or with the mouse pointer.
</p></item>
<item><p> 
You can also use the keys <key>w</key>, <key>a</key>, <key>s</key>, <key>d</key> (for ↑←↓→ respectively) instead of the arrow keys for one-handed operation. 
</p></item>
<item><p> 
 Previews of applications with a single window are only available when the Down arrow is explicitly hit. 
</p></item>
<item><p> 
 
     It is possible to switch to any window by moving to it with the mouse and clicking. 
</p></item>
<item><p>
  <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>`</key></keyseq> switches between windows of the same application in <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq>.  The <key>`</key> is above the <key>Tab</key>.
