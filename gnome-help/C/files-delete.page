<title>Delete files and folders</title>

<p>
If you don't want a file or folder any more, you can delete it.
</p>

<p>
When you delete an item it is moved to the Trash folder, where it is stored until you empty the trash.  Items stored in the Trash folder can be restored to their original location if you decide you need them, or if they were accidentally deleted.
</p>

<steps>
  <title>Move a file or folder to the trash</title>
  <item><p>Select the item you want to delete by clicking it once.</p></item>
  <item><p>Press the <gui>Delete</gui> key on your keyboard. Alternatively,
  drag the item to the <gui>Trash</gui> in the sidebar.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>To delete files permanently, and to free up disk space on your
computer, you need to empty the trash. To empty the trash, right-click
<gui>Trash</gui> in the sidebar and select <gui>Empty Trash</gui>.
Alternatively, you can permanently delete individual items in the
trash by navigating to the trash from the sidebar or the
<gui>Go</gui> menu. Select files you want to delete permanently
and press the <key>Del</key> key on your keyboard, or right-click
and select <gui>Delete Permanently</gui>.</p>

<p>You can immediately delete a file permanently, without having to
send it to the trash first.</p>

<steps>
  <title>Permanently delete a file or folder</title>
  <item><p>Select the item you want to delete.</p></item>
  <item><p>Press and hold the <gui>Shift</gui> key, then press the <key>Del</key> key on your keyboard.</p></item>
  <item><p>Because you cannot undo this, you will be asked to
  confirm that you want to delete the file or folder.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>If you frequently need to delete files without using the trash
(for example, if you often work with sensitive data), you can add
a <gui>Delete</gui> entry to the right-click menu for files and
folders. Click <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui></guiseq>
and select the <gui>Behavior</gui> tab. Select <gui>Include a Delete
command that bypasses Trash</gui>.</p>
