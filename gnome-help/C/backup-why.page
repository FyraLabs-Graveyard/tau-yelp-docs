  <title>Backup your important files</title>
  <p>
Backing up your files simply means to make a copy of a file or files for safekeeping. This is done in the event that the original files become unusable due to loss or corruption. These copies can be used to restore the original  data in the event of loss. Copies should be stored on a different device from the original files. For example, you may use a USB drive, an external hard drive, a CD/DVD, or an off-site service.
</p>
<p>
The best way to backup up your files is to do so regularly, off-site and encrypted.</p>
