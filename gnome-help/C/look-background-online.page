<title>Get a desktop background from the internet</title>

<p>Your system comes with many available wallpapers or desktop backgrounds; however, you may also download more from many sources online. To do this:</p>

<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Visit a website that lists downloadable wallpapers for your desktop. One excellent source is <link href="http://www.gnome-look.org">GNOME-look</link>. </p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Download the wallpaper you have selected and save it on your computer. To do this, simply right click on the picture and select the <gui>Save</gui> option.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>To add the downloaded wallpaper to the available backgrounds in your system, right-click anywhere on the desktop, making sure not to click on an icon, and choose the <gui>Change Desktop Background</gui> option. </p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Select the <gui>Background</gui> tab and click on the <gui>Add</gui> button.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>On the <gui>Add Wallpaper</gui> window, navigate to the location of the downloaded wallpaper. Click on the wallpaper to select it.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Click <gui>Open</gui>. This will automatically add the new wallpaper to your system's background selection. Your current desktop background will also be changed to the new picture.</p>
 </item>
<p> To finish, just click on <gui>Close</gui> </p>
</steps>
<p>You can drag and drop the picture into the <gui>Background</gui> tab to add it to the selection, instead of clicking <gui>Add</gui>.</p>

<note><p>You can use any picture for your desktop background; however, you may want to use pictures that are the right size for your desktop. Using a picture that is either too small or too big may not provide a very pleasing effect.</p></note>
