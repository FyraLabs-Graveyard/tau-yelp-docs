  <title>What Should You Backup?</title>

<p>
Your priority should be to backup your most important files as well as those that are difficult to recreate.  An example of most important to least important:
</p>

<terms>
 <item>
   <title>Your personal files </title>
   <p>Documents, spreadsheets, email, calendar data, financial data, music, anything that you made that has importance to you. These are clearly the most important as they may be irreplaceable.</p>
    </item>

  <item>
  <title>Your settings</title>
  <p> This includes changes you may have made to colours, backgrounds, screen resolution and mouse settings on your desktop. This also includes program preferences, such as settings for OpenOffice, your music player, and your email program. These are replaceable, but may take up valuable time to recreate.</p>
</item>

<item>
<title> System settings. </title>
<p>Most people never change the settings that are created during installation. If you do customize your system, you may wish to backup these settings.
</p>
</item>

<item>
<title> Installed software (and everything else). </title>
<p> Such software can usually be restored by reinstalling, but not always.</p>
</item>
</terms>

    <p>
    In general, you will want to backup files that are irreplaceable without a backup.  </p>
