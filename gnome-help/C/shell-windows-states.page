<title>Show, hide, resize and arrange windows</title>

<p>Briefly explain the different window states that exist and how you can use and recognize those states. Discuss interesting ways of arranging windows (i.e. if there is a "Tile" option or something like that). Mention, in passing, how you can move and resize windows in multiple ways.</p>
