   <p>Explain that the (wireless/optical) mouse or touchpad might need to be woken up (e.g. by clicking a button or wiggling the mouse for a while) before they will work.</p>

  Wireless and optical mice, as well as touchpads no laptops may need to "wake up" before they will work.  To wake up your mouse or touchpad you can click on a mouse button or wiggle the mouse.

  Laptop touchpads sometimes have a delay after you stop typing before they will start working.  This is to prevent you from accidently touching the touchpad with your palm while typing.
