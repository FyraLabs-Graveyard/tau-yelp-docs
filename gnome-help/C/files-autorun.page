<title>Open an application when you plug in a disk/camera/audio player</title>

<p>You can have an application automatically start when you plug in a device - for example, you might want your photo organizer to start when you plug in a digital camera. You can also turn this off, so that nothing happens when you plug something in.</p>

<p>To decide which applications should start when you plug in various devices:</p>

<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Click your name on the top bar and click <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Open <gui>Removable Media</gui> and change the options under <gui>Select how media should be handled</gui>.</p>
  <p>Instead of simply starting an application, you can also set it so that:</p>
  <list>
   <item><p>The device will be shown in the File Manager (choose <gui>Open folder</gui>)</p></item>
   <item><p>You will be asked what to open (<gui>Ask what to do</gui>)</p></item>
   <item><p>Nothing at all will happen (<gui>Do nothing</gui>).</p></item>
  </list>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>The <gui>Software</gui> option is slightly different from the others - if the computer detects that there is software on a disk that you inserted, it can try to automatically run the software if you like. This is good if you have an application installed on a CD and want it to start when the disc is inserted (for example, a slideshow).</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>If you can't see the device/media type that you want to change on the list (for example, Blu-ray discs), click <gui>Other Media</gui> to see a more detailed list of devices.</p>
 </item>
</steps>

<note style="tip">
 <title>Don't open <em>any</em> applications automatically</title>
 <p>If you don't want any applications to be opened automatically, whatever you plug in, check <gui>Never prompt or start programs on media insertion</gui> at the bottom of the Removable Media window.</p>
