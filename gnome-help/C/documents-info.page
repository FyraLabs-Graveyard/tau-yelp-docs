    <p>This assumes the reader knows how to sort and search documents and 
      collections. By the end of this page, the reader will be able to:
     - Explain how you can view metadata, and what metadata is typically stored.
     - Mention that this metadata is searched.</p>
  </comment>

  <p>This property is not implemented yet. When you created a document, metadata
    is also created. Metadata adds information about the document you created. 
    This metadata is stored and can be searched to hide them if you do not want 
    to share some personal information or any privacy document.
  </p>
