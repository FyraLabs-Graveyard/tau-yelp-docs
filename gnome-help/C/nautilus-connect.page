<title>Browse files on a server or network share</title>

<p>You can connect to a server or network share to browse and
view files on that server, exactly as if they were on your
local machine or removable device. This is a convenient way
to download or upload files, or to share files with users on
your local network.</p>

<steps>
  <title>Connect to a file server</title>
  <item><p>From the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, open the application
  <app>Files</app>. This will bring up the file manager in your home
  folder.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Connect to Server</gui></guiseq>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Enter the server address, select the type of server,
  and enter any additional information as required.
  Then click <gui>Connect</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>A new window will open showing you the files on the server.
  Browse the files and folders just as you would for local files and
  folders.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>Connecting to a server will also add that server to the sidebar
so you can access it quickly in the future. If you do not see the
sidebar in the file manager, click <guiseq><gui>View</gui>
<gui>Sidebar</gui><gui>Show Sidebar</gui></guiseq>.</p>

<p>You can connect to different types of servers. Some servers
are public, and allow anybody to connect. Other servers require
you to log in with a user name and password. You may not have
permissions to perform certain actions on files on a server.
For example, on public FTP sites, you will probably not be
able to delete files.</p>

<title>Types of servers</title>
<item>
  <title>SSH</title>
  <p>If you have a <em>secure shell</em> account on a server, you
  can connect using this method. Many web hosts provide SSH accounts
  to members so they can securely upload files. SSH servers always
  require you to log in. If you use a secure shell key to log in,
  leave the password field blank.</p>
  <comment><cite>shaunm</cite><p>We should have a topics on encryption
  keys, possibly rolling the seahorse help into gnome-help. Then link
  from here.</p></comment>
  <p>When using SSH, all the data you send (including your password)
  is encrypted so that other users on your network can't sniff it.</p>
</item>
<item>
  <title>FTP (with login)</title>
  <p>FTP is a popular protocol for exchanging files on the Internet.
  Because data is not encrypted over FTP, many servers now provide
  access through SSH. Some servers, however, still allow or require
  you to use FTP to upload or download files. FTP sites with logins
  will usually allow you to delete and upload files.</p>
</item>
<item>
  <title>Public FTP</title>
  <p>Sites that allow you to download files will sometimes provide
  public or anonymouse FTP access. These servers do not require a
  user name and password, and will usually not allow you to delete
  or upload files.</p>
  <note><p>Some anonymous FTP sites require you to log in with a
  public user name and password, or with a public user name using
  your email address as the password. For these servers, use the
  <gui>FTP (with login)</gui> method, and use the credentials
  specified by the FTP site.</p></note>
