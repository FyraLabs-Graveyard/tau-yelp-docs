<title>File manager behavior</title>
<p>To specify your file manager behavior preferences, click <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui></guiseq>, and select the <gui>Behavior</gui> tab.</p>

<section id="behavior">
<title>Behavior</title>
<p>You can select one of the following default behaviors to open files and folders.</p>
<terms>
 <item>
  <title>Single click to open items</title>
  <p>This behavior will underline the item when you point to it.  One click will open the file or folder you point to.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <title>Double click to open items</title>
  <p>This behavior requires a <link xref="mouse-problem-doubleclick">double click</link> to open the file or folder you click on.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <title>Open each folder in its own window</title>
  <p>If this option is left unchecked, folders will open in the same window you are in, replacing the view of the outer folder contents, with the view of the contents of the selected folder.</p>
<p>Checking this option will open the selected folder in a new window, allowing you to view both the contents of the outer folder and the selected folder in separate windows.</p>
 </item>
</terms>

</section>
<section id="executable">
<title><gui>Executable Text Files</gui></title>
 <p>An executable text file is a file that contains a program that you can run (execute).  The <link xref="nautilus-file-properties-permissions#execute">file permissions</link> must also allow for the file to run as a program.  The most common are Shell, Python and Perl scripts.  These have extensions .sh, .py and .pl respectively.</p>
 <p>You can select to <gui>Run executable text files when they are opened</gui>, <gui>View executable text files when they are opened</gui> or <gui>Ask each time</gui>. If the last option is selected, a dialog box will appear asking if you wish to run or view the selected text file.</p>


</section>
<section id="trash">
<title>Trash</title>

<terms>
 <item>
  <title><gui>Ask before emptying the Trash or deleting files</gui></title>
  <p>This option is selected by default.  When emptying the trash, a message will be displayed confirming that you would like to empty the trash or delete files.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <title><gui>Include a delete command that bypasses Trash</gui></title>
  <p>Selecting this option will add a <gui>Delete</gui> menu item to the <gui>Edit</gui> menu as well as the menu that pops up when you right-click on an item in the <app>File Manager</app>.</p>
<note style="warning">
<p>Deleting an item using the <gui>Delete</gui> menu option bypasses the Trash altogether.  The item is removed from the system completely.  There is no way to recover the deleted item.</p>
