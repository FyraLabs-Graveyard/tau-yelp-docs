<title>What does it mean when a file has "~" in its name?</title>

<p>Files with "~" at the end of their names (for example, <file>example.txt~</file>) are hidden files. They are often created automatically by applications as backup copies of documents. It is normally safe to delete them, but check before you do.</p>

<p>These files are treated in the same way as normal hidden files. See <link xref="files-hidden"/> for advice on dealing with hidden files.</p>
