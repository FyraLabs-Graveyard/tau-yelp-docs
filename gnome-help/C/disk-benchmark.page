    <desc>You can run benchmarks on your hard disk to check how fast it is.</desc>
  </info>

<title>Test the performance of your hard disk</title>
<p>To test the performance of the hard disk, you can use <gui>Disk Utility</gui>, that can open by following this steps:</p>
<steps>
    <item><p>Go to the <gui>Activities</gui>, in the corner at the top left of the screen.</p></item>
    <item><p>Start typing 'Disk Utility'.</p></item> 
    <item><p>Press enter or just click on the <gui>Disk Utility</gui> icon.</p></item>
</steps>
<p>Once that you are in  <gui>Disk Utility</gui>, to run a benchmark:</p>
<steps>
    <item><p>Choose the hard disk, by clicking on it, in the <gui>Storage Devices</gui> list.</p></item>
    <item><p>It will appear some information about the disk and its status in <gui>Drive</gui>, now choose <gui>Benchmark</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>You can choose between starting a Read-Only Benchmark or a Start/Write Benchmark, by clicking on one of them.</p></item>
    <item><p>Wait until it finish.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>When the test finish, you will get a chart with the results.</p>

<note style="tip"><p> Another way to get to <gui>Disk Utility</gui> it is by using the <em>command name</em>, which you can do by pressing <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq>, entering 'palimpsest' (without the single-quotes) and pressing <key>Enter</key>.</p></note>
