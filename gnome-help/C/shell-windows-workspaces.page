<title>What is a workspace, and how will it help me?</title>

<p>Workspaces refer to the grouping of windows on your desktop.
  You can create many workspaces, which act like virtual desktops.
Workspaces are meant to reduce clutter and make the desktop easier to navigate.</p>

<p>You could use workspaces to organize your work.  For example, you could have all your communication windows, such as e-mail and your chat program on one workspace and the work you are doing on a different workspace.  Your music manager could be on a third workspace.</p>
