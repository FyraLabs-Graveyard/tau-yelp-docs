  <title>What is Bluetooth visibility?</title>

  <p>Bluetooth visibility simply refers to whether other devices can discover
  your computer when searching for Bluetooth devices. When Bluetooth is turned
  on and the <gui>Bluetooth</gui> panel is open, your computer will advertise
  itself to all other devices within range, allowing them to attempt to connect
  to you.</p>

  <note>
    <p>To indicate that your computer is visible while the <gui>Bluetooth</gui>
    panel is open, the <em>visible name</em> is displayed. The name appears in
    the label above the device list, <gui>Visible as "Jo's Desktop"</gui>, for
    example, and can be <link xref="sharing-displayname">changed</link> from
    the <gui>Sharing</gui> panel.</p>
  </note>

  <p>Your computer does not need to be visible to search for other devices, but
  those devices need to be visible for your computer to discover them.</p>

  <p>After you have
  <link xref="bluetooth-connect-device">connected to a device</link>,
  neither your computer nor the device needs to be visible to communicate with
  each other.</p>

<!--
  <p>Unless you or someone you trust needs to connect to your computer from
  another device, you should leave visibility off.</p>
