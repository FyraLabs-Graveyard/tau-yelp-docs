<title>Notifications and the message tray</title>

<section id="what">
<title>What is a notification?</title>
<p>If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, a notification will be shown at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For example, if you get a new chat message, new updates are available for your computer, or your computerâ€™s battery is low, you will get a notification informing you about that.</p>
<p>To minimize distraction, the notification will first appear as a single line. You can move your mouse over it if you want to see its full content.</p>

<title>The message tray</title>
<p>The message tray gives you a way to get back to your notifications when it is convenient for you. It appears when you move your mouse to the bottom right corner of the screen and contains all the notifications that you have not acted upon or that permanently reside in it.</p>
<p>You can view the notifications by clicking on the message tray items. The items in the message tray are usually applications that sent you notifications. However, chat notifications are given special treatment and are represented by the individual contacts who sent you the chat messages.</p>
<p>The message tray is always visible in the activities overview.</p>
