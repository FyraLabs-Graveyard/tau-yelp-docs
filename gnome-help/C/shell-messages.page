<section id="what"><title>What are Messages?</title>
<p>
If an application wants to get your attention, it will show a message at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to open <gui>System Settings</gui> and it's already opened, a message will appear saying: "System Settings 'System Settings' is ready".
</p>

<section id="replay">
 <title>Replay notifications</title>
 <p>If you missed one message shown or just want to replay it, move the pointer to the bottom-right corner and it will reappear.</p>
<p>If more than one notification has been shown, you will have to click on the icon that represents the message you want to replay.</p>
