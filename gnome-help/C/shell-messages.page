<section id="what"><title>What are Messages?</title>
<p>
If an application wants to get your attention, it'll show a message at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to open <gui>System Settings</gui> and it's already opened, it will appear a message that says: "System Settings 'System Settings' is ready".
</p>

<section id="replay">
 <title>Replay notifications</title>
 <p>If you missed one message shown or just want to replay it, just move the pointer to the right-bottom corner and it will reappear.</p>
<p>If more than one notifications has been shown, you will have to click in the icon that represents the message you want to replay.</p>
