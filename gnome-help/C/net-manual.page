<title>Manually set network settings</title>

<p>If your network doesn't automatically assign network settings to your computer, you may have to manually enter the settings yourself. This topic assumes that you already know the correct settings to use. If not, you may need to ask your network administrator or look at the settings of your router or switch.</p>

<p>To manually set your network settings:</p>

<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Click the network icon on the top bar and click <gui>Edit Connections</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Find the network connection that you want to set-up manually. For example, if you plug-in to the network with a cable, look at the <gui>Wired</gui> tab.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Click the connection you want to edit to select it, then click <gui>Edit</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Go to the <gui>IPv4 Settings</gui> tab and change the <gui>Method</gui> option to <gui>Manual</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Click <gui>Add</gui> and type the <em>IP address</em>, <em>network mask</em> and <em>default gateway IP address</em> into the corresponding columns of the <gui>Addresses</gui> list. Press <key>Enter</key> or <key>Tab</key> after typing each address.</p>
  <p>These three addresses must be IP addresses; that is, they must be four numbers separated by periods (e.g. 123.45.6.78).</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Type the IP addresses of the DNS servers you want to use in the corresponding field, separated by commas.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Click <gui>Save</gui>. If you are not connected to the network, go to the network icon on the top bar and connect to it. Test the network settings by trying to visit a website or look at shared files on the network, for example.</p>
