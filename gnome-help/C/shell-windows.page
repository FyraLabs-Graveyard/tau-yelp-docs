<title>Windows and workspaces</title>

<p>Like other desktops, Gnome Shell uses windows to display your running applications. Using both the <gui>overview</gui> and the <gui>dash</gui>, you can launch new applications and control which window is active.</p>
 <p>In the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, the <gui>dash</gui> displays your favorite applications as well as your running applications. The <gui>dash</gui> will place a slight glow behind any running applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clicking on the application icon will launch it if it is not running, and will open the last used window of that application if it is already running.
</p>

<p>
Right clicking on the application icon for a running application will bring all windows for that application forward. A menu with the titles of your windows will be displayed.  You can select a window from this menu. It also provides options to open a new window for that application and to remove or add that application to favorites depending on its current status.
</p>

<p>
   Windows are shown on their corresponding <link xref="shell-windows-workspaces">workspaces</link>.
