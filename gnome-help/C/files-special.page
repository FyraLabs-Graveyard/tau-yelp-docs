<title>Mark a file as being special or important</title>

<p>You can use <em>emblems</em> to mark files as being special in some way. For example, if you wanted to</p>

<steps>
 <item><p>Right-click the file and select <gui>Properties</gui>.</p></item>
 <item><p>Go to the <gui>Emblems</gui> tab and check the emblems that you want to use.</p></item>
 <item><p>The emblems you chose will appear over the file. (You can just close the <gui>Properties</gui> window when you've finished.)</p></item>
</steps>

<p>To remove an emblem, follow the same steps as above, but <em>uncheck</em> the emblem you want to remove.</p>

<p>You can add as many emblems as you like to a file. If you add more than four, however, some of the emblems will not be displayed because there isn't enough space for them all.</p>

<note style="tip">
 <p>You can add emblems to folders too. The procedure is the same as for files.</p>
</note>

<p>If you send a file to someone else (for example, by email), the other person will not be able to see the emblems you added. The emblems you add to a file are only visible to you (in your user account).</p>
