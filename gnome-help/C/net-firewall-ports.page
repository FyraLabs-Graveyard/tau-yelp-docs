  <title>Firewall port list</title>
  <p>The following table lists ports used by your system's firewall to <link xref="net-firewall-on-off">block or allow access</link> to GNOME programs over the network. There are thousands of ports in use, so this table isn't complete. Instead, it presents some of the most common ports you may want to configure on your system. In some cases, the vendor of your GNOME desktop may have pre-configured access to these ports when the system was installed.</p>
