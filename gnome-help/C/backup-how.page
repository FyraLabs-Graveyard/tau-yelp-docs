  <title>How to backup</title>


    <p>
    Your <link xref="backup-thinkabout">personal files</link> and settings are usually in your home directory.
 </p
><p>
If you have the room, it is best to backup the entire home directory with the following exceptions:
    </p>

<list>
 <item><p>Files that you have copied from a CD, DVD, or other removable media, since it would be faster to copy them again than to restore them from backup.</p></item>
 <item><p>Files that you can generate easily. For example, PDF's that can be generated from TeX files, or object files that can be made with the Make utility.  Just ensure the source is backed up.</p></item>
 <item><p>Your trashed files, which can be found in <cmd>~/.local/share/Trash</cmd></p></item>
</list>

<p>
The amount of data you can backup is limited by the size of the storage device.
</p>
     <p>
   One simple way to backup your files is to just <link xref="files-copy">copy them</link> to a safe location, such as an external hard drive, another computer on the network or a USB drive.
   </p>
   <note style="tip">
   <p> <media type="image" src = "figures/deja-dup.png"/>
   Alternatively, you can use an app that can back your files up for you.  </p><p>  One such app is <app>Déjà Dup</app>.  It is very simply and intuitive to use, and it hides the complexity of doing backups regularly, off-site and encrypted.
</p>
<p>
 The <app>Déjà Dup</app> help will walk you through setting your preferences for the backup, as well as how to restore your data from the backup.
