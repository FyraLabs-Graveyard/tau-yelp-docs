    <title>What Is GNOME?</title>
    <para>    
      GNOME is a user-friendly graphical desktop environment for UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems.  GNOME includes a panel (for starting
      applications and displaying status), a desktop (where data and
      applications can be placed), a set of standard desktop tools and
      applications, and a set of conventions that make it easy for
      applications to cooperate and be consistent with each other.
      Users of other operating systems or environments should feel
      right at home using the powerful graphics-driven environment
      GNOME provides. GNOME runs on a number of UNIX-like operating
      systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. 
    </para>
   <para> GNOME is completely open source (free software) developed by
      hundreds of programmers around the world. Both the source code
      and ready-to-run binaries of GNOME are available for download on
      the Internet; they are distributed under the terms of the <ulink
      type="help" url="ghelp:gpl"> GNU General Public
      License</ulink> (and its cousins, <ulink type="help"
      url="ghelp:lgpl">Lesser General Public License</ulink> and
      <ulink type="help" url="ghelp:fdl">Free Documentation
      License</ulink> for libraries and documentation
      respectively). In particular, this means that everyone is free
      to use, copy or distribute GNOME. If you would like to learn
      more about the GNOME project please visit the <ulink
      url="http://www.gnome.org" type="http">GNOME website</ulink>.
   </para>
   <para>
      GNOME is highly configurable, enabling you to set your desktop
      the way you want it to look and feel.  GNOME supports many human
      languages, and more are added every month.  GNOME even supports
      several drag and drop protocols for maximum interoperability
      with non-GNOME applications.
   </para>

   <para>
    GNOME comes from the acronym for the GNU Network Object Model
    Environment (GNOME).  GNOME is a part of the larger GNU project,
    started in 1984 to develop a completely free UNIX-like operating
    system.  For more information, visit the <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org" type="http">GNU website</ulink>.  
    </para>
    <para>
      This guide describes GNOME 2.0 which is the latest (as of June 
      2002) release of GNOME.

<sect1 id="about">
    <title>Purpose of This Document</title>
    <para>
      This document gives you a short introduction to GNOME. It is not
      intended to cover all details of GNOME; if you need more
      information, you should read the detailed manuals listed in <xref
      linkend="otherinfo"/>. Also, this document assumes you already have
      GNOME installed; if you need help installing GNOME, please check
      the instructions on the <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org"
      type="http">GNOME website</ulink>.
    </para>
 
    <para> This document was written by the members of the GNOME
      Documentation Project (GDP). If you have any comments or
      suggestions about this document or if you can offer any other
      help in improving or translating GNOME documentation, please
      send an e-mail to <email>docs@gnome.org</email>, or visit the <ulink
      url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/" type="http">GDP
      website</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para> The authors of this document assume that you are
      using the default configuration of GNOME (that is, default GTK
      theme and <application>Sawfish</application> window manager with
      <guilabel>Crux</guilabel> theme). GNOME is highly
      configurable, so it is easy to change not only the look but also
      the behavior of GNOME; however, we recommend that you do so only
      after you already have some experience with GNOME.
    </para>
  </sect1>
<!-- ==================Section: ======================== -->
<sect1 id="conventions">
    <title>Mouse Conventions Used in This Document</title> 
    <para>
      Before  describing GNOME, let us introduce some terms used not 
      only in this guide but in all GNOME documents. Most importantly,
      we need to clarify the use of mouse buttons and clicks. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Most GNOME documents assume that you are using a standard (for
      UNIX) 3-button mouse and talk about left, right, and middle
      mouse buttons; if a document says <quote>click</quote> without
      explicitly specifying the button, the left button is
      assumed. <!-- Some documents use notations <quote>mouse button
      1</quote>, <quote>mouse button 2</quote> and <quote>mouse button
      3</quote> (or MB1, MB2, MB3 for short) for left, middle, and
      right buttons respectively. -->
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are using a two-button mouse, you can emulate the middle
      mouse button by pressing left and right buttons simultaneously;
      if you have a wheel mouse, the wheel can be used in place of the
      middle mouse button.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can switch the roles of the buttons using the <application>Mouse
      preference tool</application> in the <guisubmenu>Desktop
      Preferences</guisubmenu> submenu of
      <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu. Many left-handers
      choose to reverse the right and left buttons. If you have done
      so, you need to use the right mouse button whenever a document
      instructs you to click, and use the <emphasis>left</emphasis> mouse
      button whenever a document talks about
      <quote>right-clicking</quote> or mouse button 3.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you use a mouse with an unusual placement of buttons, a
      trackball, or some other input device, you need to find out
      which buttons correspond to <quote>right</quote>,
      <quote>left</quote> and <quote>middle</quote>; this information
      can usually be found in the manual which came with your
      device. Usually, the <quote>left</quote> button (MB1) is the one
      under your index finger. 
    </para>

<sect2 id="panel">
      <title>Panel</title>
      <para>
	The two long bars at the top and bottom of <xref
	linkend="desktop-fig"/> are <emphasis>panels</emphasis>. The
	top one is called the menu panel, the bottom one is an edge
	panel (you can have more than one  edge panel). 
	  Panels can contain a number of useful objects, such as 
      </para>
      <variablelist>
        <!-- ############## -->
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><guibutton>GNOME Menu</guibutton> button</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>This is the button with the stylized footprint (in
	      the example of <xref linkend="desktop-fig"/>, it is the
	      left-most button on the top panel). Clicking this button
	      brings up a menu containing all GNOME applications and
	      commands, including the logout command.
	    </para> 
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
        <!-- ############## -->
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Other menus</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Panels can also contain other menus, either submenus of
	    the <guimenu>GNOME Menu</guimenu> or menus created by
	    the user. In the example above, the top panel contains
	    <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> and
	    <guimenu>Actions</guimenu> menus. Both are
	    actually submenus of the  <guimenu>GNOME Menu</guimenu>.
	    </para> 
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

        <!-- ############## -->
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Application launchers</term>

	    <para>These buttons start various programs.

	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
        <!-- ############## -->
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Panel applets</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>These are tiny programs designed to
	      work inside the panel. For example, the
	      <application>clock</application> applet on the far right
	      of the top panel    shows the current time, and the
	      <application>Window List</application> applet (in the
	      left side of the bottom panel) shows the list of all application
	      windows  on your desktop (this will be discussed in
	      detail in <xref linkend="tasklist"/>). 
	    </para> 
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      


      <para> As with all GNOME components, panels are highly
	configurable: you can add or remove application launchers and
	applets, edit the <guimenu>GNOME Menu</guimenu>, change the panel
	background, or even remove and create new panels. This will be
	discussed in <xref linkend="customizing-panel"/>. 
      </para>
      <note>
	<title>NOTE</title>
	<para>
	  The top panel in <xref linkend="desktop-fig"/> is called the
	  <emphasis>menu</emphasis> panel and has slightly different
	  properties than other panels. For example, you can not move
	  it to a different location.
	 </para>
	</note>
      <para>
	To configure an object, get help on it, or remove it
	from the panel, right-click on it and select the appropriate
	item from the popup menu. To hide the panel when you are not
	using it, click on one of the <guibutton>Hide
	buttons</guibutton>.  They are the small arrows at the ends of the
	panel.
      </para>
      <para>More panel operations are available from the
	<guimenu>Panel</guimenu> menu, which you can open by
	right-clicking in any vacant space on the panel (for example,
	in the hide arrows) and selecting
	<guisubmenu>Panel</guisubmenu> from the menu. The
	<guimenu>Panel</guimenu> menu also contains the <ulink type="help"
	url="ghelp:panel">Panel manual</ulink>, which describes
	all these options in detail.  </para>
    </sect2>
<!-- =======Subsection ============ -->
    <sect2 id="desktop"> 
      <title>Desktop</title> 
      <para>
	Everything outside the panel is called the 
	<quote>desktop</quote>. You can place icons for files, applications,
        and other items on the desktop (a default collection of icons is
        installed with GNOME).  You can then double-click on an item
        to use it:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
	<listitem>
	  <para>   
	    If the item is a program, that program will start.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    If it is a data file, the appropriate program will start
	    up with that data loaded.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>  

	  <para>
	    If it is a folder (directory), the <application>File
	    Manager</application> will start and show the contents of
	    that directory. Your desktop will probably have an icon
	    showing a house and labeled as 
	    <guilabel><replaceable>yourname</replaceable>'s
	    Home</guilabel>. Double-clicking on this icon will start
	    the <application>File Manager</application> in your home
	    directory.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	The easiest way to place an item on the desktop is to drag a
	file from a file manager window, as described in detail in
	the <ulink type="help" url="ghelp:nautilus">Nautilus
	manual</ulink>. Once the item is placed on the desktop, you
	can move it around the desktop using the left mouse button, or
	you can click on it with the right mouse button to bring up
	the popup menu which allows you to delete the item or change
	its properties.
    </para>
    </sect2>

<!-- =======Subsection ============ -->
    <sect2 id="mouse"> 
      <title>Using the Mouse</title> 
      <para>    
	As you have already seen, you can do almost anything just by
	clicking with your mouse. Here are some conventions which work
	almost anywhere in GNOME:
      </para> 

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet"> 
	<listitem><para>

      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	In addition, right-clicking on any vacant
	place on your desktop brings up the <guimenu>Desktop
	Background</guimenu> menu, which allows you to change the desktop
	background or other properties, or add a new object to the
	desktop. Clicking on the desktop with the middle mouse button
	produces the <guimenu>Root</guimenu> menu, provided by the
	window manager (see <xref linkend="windows"/>).  </para>

      <para> To log out of GNOME, click on the <guimenu>GNOME Menu</guimenu>
	button and select <guimenuitem>Log out</guimenuitem>. GNOME
	will prompt you for confirmation; it will also give you an
	option to save the session &mdash; that is, information about
	currently open applications and their location on the screen
	will be saved, so that when you login next time, the same
	applications will be in the same places (this only works for

<!-- ==================Section: working with windows =============== -->
<sect1 id="windows">
    <title>Working With Windows</title>
    <para>
      The X
      Window System, a graphical system used by all UNIX-like 
      operating systems, allows you to have several windows on your
      screen, with a different application running in each window. By
      itself, however, the X Window System can only do very low-level
      operations, so it is always used in combination with another
      piece of software, called a <emphasis>window manager</emphasis>. A
      window manager provides windows' frames, titlebar, and buttons.
      It also allows you to move, close, and resize windows. GNOME can
      work with many window managers. The most popular are <ulink
      type="http" url="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net">
      <application>Sawfish</application></ulink> (included as part of
      the GNOME distribution) and <ulink type="http"
      url="http://www.gnome.org/softwaremap/projects/Metacity">
      <application>Metacity</application></ulink>. Each window manager
      can use many different styles of window decorations and buttons.
      (This is referred to as the <quote>window manager
      theme</quote>.)  Since it is impossible to cover them all, in
      this section we only describe the default window manager shipped
      with GNOME, <application>Sawfish</application>, and its default
      theme, <guilabel>Crux</guilabel>. An example of the window
      titlebar using the <guilabel>Crux</guilabel> theme is shown in <xref
      linkend="cruxborder"/>

	    <para> To <emphasis>close</emphasis> a window, click on
	      the <guibutton>Close Window</guibutton> button (with the
	      small <quote>x</quote>) in the window titlebar. If the
	      application has any unsaved data, it will prompt you to
	      save it.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      To <emphasis>maximize</emphasis> a window, i.e. make it
	      fill the entire screen (except for the part taken by the
	      panels), click on the <guibutton>Maximize</guibutton>
	      button (middle button on the right side). Clicking on
	      this button once again will restore the window to its
	      original size.
	    </para>
	    <para> To <emphasis>minimize</emphasis> (sometimes also
	      called hide or iconify) a window, click on the
	      <guibutton>Minimize</guibutton> button. The window will
	      disappear from the screen. However, it is not lost: the
	      application in this window continues running, no data is
	      lost &mdash; it is just temporarily hidden. All
	      minimized windows are shown in the <link

	    </para>
	    <para> A convenient alternative to minimizing windows is
	      <emphasis>shading</emphasis> them. When you shade a window, it
	      <quote>rolls up</quote> into its own titlebar, so the
	      titlebar is the only part of the window left on the
	      screen. To shade a window, click on the 
	      <guibutton>Shade</guibutton> button; to unshade, click
	      on this button again. You can also shade and unshade a 
	      window by  double-clicking on the titlebar.

	    <para> Of all the windows on your screen, only one is active
              (in computer parlance, <quote>focused</quote>), which means
              that anything you type on the keyboard will be sent to the
              application running in that window. (It does not mean that the
	      applications in other windows are idle &mdash; they can
	      be running as well.) To help you see which window has
	      focus, the titlebar of this window has a different color
	      (the left side is blue, as opposed to gray for all other
	      windows). To change the focus to another window, just click
	      anywhere in that window. You can also click in the
	      window titlebar to focus and raise the window
	      simultaneously.

	As most modern graphic file managers,

        opens this file, as configured in the <application>File Types and
        Programs </application> preference tool). Right-clicking on a

    <para>
      GNOME comes with many applications and utilities; in addition,
      GNOME allows you to use any third party applications such as
      <application>Netscape</application>), KDE applications, or other
      applications and utilities installed on your system. You can
      also use  GNOME 1.x applications under GNOME 2 (if you have
      installed appropriate GNOME 1.x libraries).

      <para>
	The contents of the <guimenu>GNOME Menu</guimenu> depends on the
	applications installed on your system. In addition, if you are
	using a copy of GNOME packaged by someone other than the GNOME
	project (for example, packaged as part of your Linux
	distribution), the menu is likely to be slightly different
	from the one described here. For example, distributors can add
	some distribution-specific applications to the menu, or even
	completely reorganize the menus. In this case refer to the
	documentation that came with your distribution.

    <sect2 id="kill-an-app">
      <title>Killing a Stalled Application</title>
      <para>
	If an application is stalled or frozen &mdash; that is, if it
	does not respond to your mouse clicks and keyboard commands,
	you can either wait and hope that it wakes up, or kill it. If
	you decide to kill it (NOTE: You will lose all unsaved data),
	start the <application>GNOME System monitor</application>
	(from <menuchoice> <guimenu>GNOME Menu</guimenu>
	<guisubmenu>Applications</guisubmenu> <guisubmenu>Sytem
	Tools</guisubmenu> </menuchoice>). Select the application you
	want to kill and click on <guibutton>End process</guibutton>
	button at the bottom. You can also right-click on the
	application name and choose <guimenuitem>End
	process</guimenuitem>; if it doesn't help, right-click and
	choose <guimenuitem>Kill process</guimenuitem>. Using the
	<application>GNOME System monitor</application> also allows
	you to find and kill all helper processes started by this
	application.
	</para>
      <para>
	If a GNOME application freezes or crashes (unexpectedly dies)
	repeatedly, you should file a bug report as described in the
	<ulink type="help" url="ghelp:gnome-feedback">GNOME feedback
	page</ulink>.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="kill-X11">
      <title>My Whole System Froze!</title> 

      <para> If your whole system is frozen and is not responding, do not
      hurry to push the power  button on the computer
      &mdash; this is usually the worst solution. Most probably, it is
      not the operating system itself that is frozen (UNIX systems are
      known for stability), but just the graphical part, the X Window
      System. In this case, you can try to restart the X Window System by
      simultaneously pressing
     <keycombo>
    <keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Backspace</keycap>
   </keycombo>.   This should work for
      the implementation of the X Window system used on Linux and *BSD,
      XFree86 (unless it was disabled by your system
      administrator). Of course, in this way you also lose all unsaved
      data, but at least you do not risk harming the whole file
      system.

	login again. If this didn't help, read on.

      <para> 
	If you have a serious  problem with your GNOME settings &mdash;
	for example, if your panel is missing &mdash; the radical solution
	is to remove all your GNOME configuration files and start from
	scratch. This is an emergency solution, as you lose all
	configuration settings and will need to configure your menus,
	panels, etc. again from scratch, that is, from the default GNOME
	configuration. However, this only affects your GNOME configuration,
	so your data files and settings for non-GNOME applications
	remain intact. 
      </para>
      <para> To remove all your GNOME configuration settings and return
	to the original GNOME configuration, logout then log in again
	holding down the keys <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and
	<keycap>Shift</keycap>. (Do so immediately after entering your
	password in the login dialog.)  You will be presented with a dialog,
	offering you the choice of resetting the saved session (that is,
        the applications open when you last logged out); resetting
        your GNOME configuration settings; or both.  
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, if you have really severe problems and your system
	freezes or becomes otherwise unusable as soon as you login,
	you have one last option. You can  select the
	<guimenuitem>Failsafe</guimenuitem> session type instead of
	the default <guimenuitem>GNOME</guimenuitem> in the login
	screen. Both GNOME and KDE Login Managers support this. In
	this session type, GNOME is not started; instead, you are
	presented with a single terminal window. This is almost
	guaranteed to start, and if you know how to use
	command-line tools to find and fix your problem, you have a
	chance. Otherwise, ask an expert.

      <title>Everything Not GNOME</title>
      <para>
	You should realize that GNOME is just part of your computer
	system. If you want to unleash the full potential of your
	computer, you need to understand not just GNOME but also the
	underlying operating system (UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD), various
	tools and utilities included with it, and its graphics system
	(the X Window System). Each of these components usually comes with
	its own documentation. Most of UNIX commands and utilities are
        documented in so-called <quote>manual pages</quote>, or man pages
        for short. You can view them using the
	<application>Yelp</application> help browser
        (see <xref linkend="Gnome-docs"/>). This documentation is usually
        very detailed and more technical than most users would like.
        Another documentation format used by utilities from the
	GNU project is called <quote>info pages</quote>. They, too,
	can be viewed using <application>Yelp</application>. Many
	applications also have documentation in other formats. Sometimes
        it is not easy to find documentation for a given application &mdash;
        try looking in the directories  <filename>/usr/share/doc</filename>
	and <filename>/usr/doc</filename>.
      </para>
      <para> Documentation for the operating system itself varies from one
        system to another. The best advice is to check the printed manual
        which came with your system. For Linux, a good source of information
        is the Linux Documentation Project (LDP); you can read  their
        documentation on the Internet at <ulink type="http"
	url="http://www.linuxdoc.org">http://www.linuxdoc.org</ulink>.
	Virtually all Linux distributions also include copies of LDP
	documents; usually they are found at
