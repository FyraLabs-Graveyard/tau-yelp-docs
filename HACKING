gnome-user-docs
===============

This module is for end-user documents with general GNOME applicability 
only.  It will be shipped as the gnome-user-docs package. 

Please respect the directory structure:
  gnome-user-docs/<docname>/<locale>/<docname>.xml
  gnome-user-docs/<docname>/<locale>/figures/

In some cases, it may make sense to nest things one level deeper.  However,
do not nest things less deep.
