This module is for end-user documents only.

Please respect the directory structure:
  gnome-user-docs/<docname>/<locale>/<docname>.sgml
  gnome-user-docs/<docname>/<locale>/figures/

In some cases, it may make sense to nest things one level deeper.  However,
do not nest things less deep.  If you have questions, please email me.
