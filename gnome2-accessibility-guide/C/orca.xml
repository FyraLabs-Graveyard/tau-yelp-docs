<title>Orca Configuration GUI</title>
<para>
The <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI allows you to customize the behavior and features of <application>Orca</application>, such as speech, braille, and magnification. For example, you can select which speech synthesis engine you want to use, whether braille is enabled or not, and which magnification preferences you want. You can select which general keyboard layout you want (desktop or laptop) and you can also examine and modify the existing keyboard layout with fine-grained control. To bring up the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI, press <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo>, where ORCA_MODIFIER is <keycap>Insert</keycap> when you use the desktop key bindings and <keycap>Caps_Lock</keycap> when you use the laptop key bindings. See also the [[Orca/AppSpecificSettings| Application Specific Settings]] page for how to set settings specific to a single application.
</para>
<para>
The <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI is a dialog containing several tabbed pages, each of which is described in the following sections.

</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
<para>
The <application>Orca</application> main window provides you with a graphical way to display the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI (also accessible with <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo>, where ORCA_MODIFIER is <keycap>Insert</keycap> when you use the desktop key bindings and <keycap>Caps_Lock</keycap> when you use the laptop key bindings). The main window also provides a <guibutton>Quit</guibutton> option, also available with <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>Q</keycap></keycombo>). Many users do not like the <application>Orca</application> main window because it shows up in the window manager's tab order when you press <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo> to switch windows. By deselecting the "Show Orca main window" button, you can tell <application>Orca</application> to not show the <application>Orca</application> main window.
</para>

<section>
<title>Quit Orca without Confirmation</title>
<para>
Normally, when you press <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>Q</keycap></keycombo> to quit <application>Orca</application> or press the <guibutton>Quit</guibutton> button in the <application>Orca</application> main window, <application>Orca</application> will pop up a confirmation dialog asking you if you want to quit. Unchecking this option prevents the confirmation window from appearing.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Disable gksu keyboard grab</title>
<para>
When running commands from the launch menu, many distributions use an application known as <application>gksu</application> to authorize the user to run these commands; <application>gksu</application> is the GUI that asks you for your password. When it runs, <application>gksu</application> enables what is known as a "keyboard grab," which is a feature to prevent keyboard actions from going to any other application on the desktop, including <application>Orca</application>.  The result of a keyboard grab is that <application>Orca</application> will not receive any keyboard events, preventing <application>Orca</application> from functioning normally.
</para>
<para>
By selecting the "Disable gksu keyboard grab" button, you will turn off the keyboard grab behavior, allowing <application>Orca</application> to function normally with system administration applications.
</para>
<note>
<para>
The keyboard grab is a security attempt by <application>gksu</application> to prevent nefarious applications from "sniffing" the keyboard and grabbing secret information.  Please be advised that disabling the gksu keyboard grab feature can expose you to such nefarious behavior. If you do not feel comfortable with this, you can always use the root account for system administration purposes. To do so, you need to enable the root account for login, and then logout and log back in as root whenever you want to perform a system administration command.
</para>
</note>
</section>

<section>
<title>Present tooltips</title>
<para>
When checked, this option will tell <application>Orca</application> to present information about tooltips when they appear as the result of mouse hovering. Specific actions to force tooltips to appear, such as pressing <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> when an object has focus, will always result in tooltips being presented, regardless of this setting.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak object under mouse</title>
<para>
When checked, this option will tell <application>Orca</application> to present information about the object under the mouse when you move it around the screen. Note that this can cause <application>Firefox</application> and <application>Thunderbird</application> versions 2.x and earlier to crash; this is not a problem with <application>Firefox</application> and <application>Thunderbird</application> versions 3.x and later.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Start Orca when you login</title>
<para>
When checked, this option will tell the system to automatically launch <application>Orca</application> when you log in.

</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
<para>
The speech page allows you to customize how <application>Orca</application> uses speech synthesis.
</para>

<section>
<title>Enable speech</title>
<para>
The first control of note on the speech page is the "enable speech" check box. This check box toggles whether or not <application>Orca</application> will make use of a speech synthesizer. This option, along with the ability to enable braille and enable magnifier support, allow <application>Orca</application> to be tailored to meet the needs of a wide variety of users.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speech System and Speech Synthesizer</title>
<para>
The next two controls deal with selecting the speech system and synthesizer. <application>Orca</application> provides support for a growing number of speech systems. At the time of this writing, these include GNOME-speech, Emacspeak, and an experimental backend for Speech Dispatcher.  Depending upon how your machine is configured, you may have all or none of these options.  Typically, you will have just GNOME-speech.
</para>
<para>
First, determine which speech system you would like to use - GNOME-speech works best at this time. After making your selection, tab to the speech synthesizer combo box and choose from the list of available synthesizers.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Voice Settings</title>
<para>
If your synthesizer supports it, <application>Orca</application> can utilize multiple voices in order to identify special cases within an application, such as hyperlinks or upper case text. The voice settings and person combo boxes can be adjusted to customize these settings to your liking. For example, assume you were using Fonix DECtalk and wanted the Betty voice to denote upper case. To accomplish this, you could do the following:
</para>
<procedure>
<step>
<para>
Tab to the voice settings combo box, and down arrow until the upper case voice is selected.
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Tab to the person combo box, and down arrow to choose the Betty voice.
</para>
</step>
</procedure>
<para>
The next three sliders in the tab order allow adjustment of the synthesizer's rate, pitch and volume, respectively.
</para>
<note>
<para>
You can quickly raise/lower the pitch by pressing <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>UpArrow</keycap></keycombo> and <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>DownArrow</keycap></keycombo>.  You can also modify the speech rate by pressing <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>LeftArrow</keycap></keycombo> and <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>RightArrow</keycap></keycombo>.
</para>
</note>
</section>

<section>
<title>Punctuation Level</title>
<para>
The punctuation level radio button group is used to adjust the amount of punctuation spoken by the synthesizer. The available levels are None, Some, Most and All.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Verbosity</title>
<para>
The verbosity setting determines the amount of information that will be spoken in certain situations. For example, if it is set to verbose, the synthesizer will speak shortcut keys for items in pull down menus. When it is set to brief, these shortcut keys are not announced.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Table Row Speech</title>
<para>
The table row speech option determines the way in which <application>Orca</application> will read items within tables. The available settings are "speak current row" or "speak current cell". The ability to adjust this behavior can be useful in many situations.  For example, consider the process of browsing email messages in <application>Evolution</application>. In this instance it may be preferable to set table speech to "speak current row" so that while arrowing through the list of messages all relevant info, such as the sender, subject, and whether the message has attachments, is read automatically. While the current row setting is active, it is still possible to read individual cells by using the left and right arrows.
</para>
<note>
<para>
You can quickly toggle this behavior by pressing <keycombo><keycap>ORCA_MODIFIER</keycap><keycap>F11</keycap></keycombo>.
</para>
</note>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak Progress Bar Updates</title>
<para>
If this setting is enabled, <application>Orca</application> will periodically announce the status of progress bars. How often the announcement is made is determined by the value chosen in the <guilabel>Update Interval</guilabel> spin button. Note that this spin button is only available if the "Speak progress bar updates" checkbox has been checked.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak Indentation and Justification</title>
<para>
When working with code or editing other documents it is often desirable to be aware of justification and indentation. Selecting the "Speak indentation and justification" check box will cause <application>Orca</application> to provide this information.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak Blank Lines</title>
<para>
Some users desire to hear "blank" when navigating to a blank line in a document.  Other users do not. If the "speak blank lines" check box is selected, <application>Orca</application> will speak blank lines.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Speak tutorial messages</title>
<para>
When moving from component to component in an interface, this option will provide spoken tutorial messages for how to work with the component.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Say All By</title>
<para>
This combo box allows you to specify whether the "say all" functionality of <application>Orca</application> speaks by sentence or line (see Desktop Keyboard Layout and Laptop Keyboard Layout for how to invoke the "say all" functionality).
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section>
<title>Braille Page</title>

<para>
The braille page allows you to customize various aspects about the use of braille. See also Using Orca with BrlTTY for more information on configuring and setting up BrlTTY.
</para>
<note>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> does not automatically start BrlTTY for you; typically you need to do this yourself, usually at boot time.
</para>
</note>

<section>
<title>Enable Braille Support</title>
<para>
The first control on the braille page is the "enable braille support" check box. This check box toggles whether or not <application>Orca</application> will make use of a braille display. This option, along with the ability to enable braille and enable magnifier support, allow <application>Orca</application> to be tailored to meet the needs of a wide variety of users. By default, this check box is enabled. If BrlTTY is not running, <application>Orca</application> will recover gracefully and will not communicate with the braille display. If you configure BrlTTY later on, you need to restart <application>Orca</application> in order for it to use braille.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Enable Braille Monitor</title>
<para>
<application>Orca</application>'s braille monitor provides an on-screen representation of what takes place on the braille display. This feature is mostly for demonstration purposes, but is also useful for <application>Orca</application> developers who do not have access to a braille display.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Abbreviated Role Names</title>
<para>
The "abbreviated role names" check box determines the manner in which role names are displayed and can be used to help conserve real estate on the braille display. The "abbreviated role names" option can be better understood if we consider the following example. Let us assume that a slider had focus, and that the abbreviated role names box was not checked. In this case, the word "slider" would be shown on the display, to reflect the fact that the current control was indeed a slider. If the abbreviated role names box were checked, the word "slider" would be abbreviated to "sldr".
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Disable end of line symbol</title>
<para>
When checked, this feature tells <application>Orca</application> to not present the "$l" string at the end of a line.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Contracted Braille</title>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> supports contracted braille via the <ulink url="http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Braille#Braille">liblouis project</ulink>, where you can find additional information about setting up liblouis with <application>Orca</application>.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Verbosity</title>
<para>
The verbosity radio button group determines the amount of information that will be brailled in certain situations. For example, if it is set to verbose, keyboard shortcut and role name information is displayed. This information is not displayed in brief mode.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Selection Indicator</title>
<para>
When you select text, <application>Orca</application> will "underline" that text on your braille display with Dots 7 and 8. If you would prefer, you can change the indicator to only be Dot 7, only be Dot 8, or not be present at all.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Hyperlink Indicator</title>
<para>

<section>
<title>Enable Key Echo</title>
<para>
The first control on the key echo page is the "enable key echo" check box. When this box is selected, six additional check boxes become available. These are: Enable alphanumeric and punctuation keys, Enable modifier keys, Enable locking keys, Enable function keys, Enable action keys, and Enable navigation keys.
</para>
<para>
The alphanumeric and function key groups are relatively self explanatory.
</para>
<para>
Modifier keys are those such as <keycap>Shift</keycap>, <keycap>Control</keycap>, and <keycap>Alt</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
Locking keys include <keycap>Caps Lock</keycap>, <keycap>Scroll Lock</keycap> and <keycap>Num Lock</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
The action keys group consists of keys that perform some logical action, such as <keycap>Backspace</keycap>, <keycap>Return</keycap> and <keycap>Tab</keycap>.
</para>
<para>
The navigation keys group include the four arrow keys as well as any key combination in which the Orca Modifier key is being held down. The latter is designed to prevent <application>Orca</application> from echoing flat review commands.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Enable Echo by Word</title>
<para>
The next toggle on the key echo page is the "enable echo by word" check box, used to echo the word you just typed. The "echo by word" control is always available, regardless of whether any of the key echo options are checked.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Enable Echo by Sentence</title>
<para>
The last toggle on the key echo page is the "enable echo by sentence" check box, used to echo the sentence you just typed. The echo by sentence control is always available, regardless of whether any of the key echo options are checked.

The key bindings page allows you to examine and modify the key bindings for <application>Orca</application>.
</para>

<section>
<title>Orca Modifier Key(s)</title>
<para>
The first control on the key bindings page allows you to examine which key (or keys) acts as the "<application>Orca</application> modifier." The <application>Orca</application> modifier is the key that you press and hold in conjunction with other keys to give commands to <application>Orca</application>. For  desktop keyboards, the Orca modifier defaults to <keycap>Insert</keycap>. For laptop keyboards, the <application>Orca</application> modifier defaults to the <keycap>Caps Lock</keycap> key.
</para>
<note>
<para>
You cannot modify the <application>Orca</application> modifier key(s) using the Configuration GUI at this time.
</para>

<section>
<title>Key Bindings Table</title>
<para>
The key bindings table provides a list of <application>Orca</application> operations and the keys that are bound to them.
</para>
<para>
The "Function" column header is a description of the <application>Orca</application> operation to be performed.
</para>
<para>
The "Key Binding" header is the primary way to invoke the function from the keyboard. Note that the function description may include the word "Orca". This indicates that the <application>Orca</application> modifier key should be held down along with the other keys.
</para>
<para>
The "Alternate" header provides an alternate mechanism for invoking the function from the keyboard.
</para>
<para>
To modify either the "Key Binding" or the "Alternate" bindings, arrow to the cell and press <keycap>Return</keycap>. Then, press a key combination and press <keycap>Return</keycap> to confirm the new combination. When you do so, the new keystroke will be saved and the check box in the last column (the "Modified" column) will indicate that the key binding has been modified.
</para>
<para>
To undo a modified keybinding, merely arrow to the modified column, uncheck the checkbox, and press the "Apply" button <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>A</keycap></keycombo>.
</para>
<para>
Beneath the list of <application>Orca</application> keybindings, you will find a group of "unbound" commands:

</phrase>
</textobject>

<para>
These are commands which we feel will be very useful for some users, but not needed by most users. Rather than "use up" a keystroke for such commands, we have left them unassigned.  You can assign a keystroke to any of these unbound commands by following the procedure outlined above. In addition, you can unbind any bound command in a similar fashion: press <keycap>Return</keycap> to edit the keybinding, and when prompted for the new keybinding, press <keycap>Delete</keycap> or <keycap>Backspace</keycap>. You will be told that the key binding has been removed. Press <keycap>Return</keycap> to confirm.

Sometimes your speech synthesizer just doesn't say the right thing for a given string. You might prefer to hear "laughing out loud" rather than "LOL." Or there may be a name or a technical term which the synthesizer mispronounces. The pronunciation page is where you can add, edit, and delete <application>Orca</application>'s pronunciation dictionary entries. Because the pronunciation page is also part of the application-specific settings dialog that's started when you give a particular application focus and type <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo>, you can customize your entries on an as-needed basis for each application you use.

<para>
<application>Orca</application> will speak known text attribute information about an object when you press <keycombo><keycap>Insert</keycap><keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> (desktop layout) or <keycombo><keycap>Caps_Lock</keycap><keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> (laptop layout). Because the number of text attributes is large, and not everyone cares about every attribute, the "Text Attributes" tab of the configuration
GUI allows you to customize which text attributes <application>Orca</application> will present.
</para>
<para>
On this tab is a text attribute list, where each row consists of four columns:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
The name of the text attribute.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
A checkbox which the user can set to indicate whether this text attribute should be spoken or not.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
A checkbox which the user can set to indicate whether this text attribute should be "underlined" on the braille display.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
An editable "Present unless" string value. By default, not all text attributes will have this set. If present, what it means (assuming the user wants this text attribute presented) is that the value of the attribute will only be presented if it is <emphasis>not</emphasis> this value.
</para>
<para>
For example, by default the "underline" text attribute has a value of "none." If the user has this attribute checked and the user types
<keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> and the text in question is not underlined, then this
attribute is not spoken. If you always want this attribute to be spoken irrespective of whether the text is underlined, then the
attribute should be checked and the "Present unless" value cleared.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
There is also a <guibutton>Reset</guibutton> button (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>R</keycap></keycombo>) which will set the list values back to their initial state when the dialog was first displayed.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
When you initially display the text attribute pane, all your checked attributes are put at the top of the list. They are given in the order that they will be spoken and brailled.
</para>
<para>
If you decide to check others or adjust the order, there are four buttons to help you do this:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>Move to top</guibutton> (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>T</keycap></keycombo>) - moves the selected attribute to the top of the list.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>Move up one</guibutton> (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>U</keycap></keycombo>) - moves the selected attribute up one row.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>Move down one</guibutton> (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo>) - moves the selected attribute down one row.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guibutton>Move to bottom</guibutton> (<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>B</keycap></keycombo>) - moves the selected attribute to the bottom of the list.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
Beneath these push buttons is the Braille Indicator group of radio buttons. Here you can select the cell or cells to be used to indicate text which has at least one of the specified attributes. Your choices are:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>

Text attributes can also be set on an individual application basis.

<title>Orca Keyboard Commands</title>
<para>
You can get a complete list of available keyboard commands by visiting the <guilabel>Key Bindings</guilabel> page of the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI. To bring up the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI, press <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo>, where <userinput>Orca_Modifier</userinput> is the <keycap>Insert</keycap> key for the <link linkend="orca-desktop-keys">desktop layout</link> and the <keycap>Caps_Lock</keycap> key for the <link linkend="orca-laptop-keys">laptop layout</link>. Note that you can also enter <application>Orca</application>'s "learn mode" while running <application>Orca</application> by pressing <keycombo><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>H</keycap></keycombo>. When in learn mode, <application>Orca</application> will intercept all keyboard and braille input events and tell you what the effect would be.  To exit learn mode, press the <keycap>Escape</keycap> key.
</para>
<note>
<para>
<application>Orca</application> provides additional commands for some applications, such as <application>Firefox</application>.  To get the list of additional commands for an application, press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Orca_Modifier</keycap><keycap>Space</keycap></keycombo> when that application has focus. This will bring up the <application>Orca</application> Configuration GUI in the "application-specific" state, and the additional commands will appear in the <guilabel>Key Bindings</guilabel> page.

WARNING: the MouseKeys functionality of AccessX can interfere with the <application>Orca</application> modifier key (see <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548169">bug 548169</ulink>), resulting in odd behavior. In particular, MouseKeys uses the <keycap>KP_Insert</keycap> key to emulate a mouse button press. When enabled, MouseKeys can conflict with <keycap>KP_Insert</keycap> as the <application>Orca</application> modifier, resulting in what appears to be a stuck <application>Orca</application> modifier key.  As an alternative, you can use the <link linkend="orca-laptop-keys">laptop key bindings</link>, which avoids the keypad for <application>Orca</application> commands. If you accidentally enabled MouseKeys, you can disable it via the <application>gnome-keyboard-properties</application> application.

The above commands apply when working with objects as well as when working with text.  For example, if the flat review cursor were positioned on a menu bar, pressing the "read current line" command would speak the names of all visible menus. Similarly, pressing the "read next word" command would speak the object to the right of the flat review cursor on the same line, or move flat review to the next line if no more objects were found.
