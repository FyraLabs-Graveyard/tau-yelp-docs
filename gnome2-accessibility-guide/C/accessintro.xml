and services, including people with disabilities. Therefore, a key goal of
Sun Microsystems is to provide a desktop that incorporates accessibility features
to enable people with disabilities to use the desktop easily and efficiently.
Recent legislation such as Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act also
heightens awareness of the need to provide accessible software. </para>

to the customization tools that are available. The customization tools enable
you to customize the appearance and behavior of the desktop.</para>
